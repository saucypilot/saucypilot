### 🎨 Artist turned Developer

As an artist, I naturally gravitated towards the **visual side of programming**. My passion lies in:

* **🎮 Game Development**: Crafting interactive worlds where art and logic meet.
* **🖥️ Computer Graphics & Vision**: Bringing visuals to life through rendering and imagery.
* **🌐 Front-end Web Development**: Designing and developing visually engaging web interfaces.
* **⚛️ Physics Simulation**: Simulating realistic and interactive environments.

### ✨ Why visuals?

Visual creativity drives my code. My background as an artist inspires me to see programming as another canvas, blending aesthetics and functionality.
